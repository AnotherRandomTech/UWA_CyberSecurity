# Project Information
This Project was completed as part of a UWA CyberSecurity Bootcamp. additional content below has been added on top of what was required by the course as further proof of understanding and sharing of skills.

The network design below contains a intentionally vulnerable web application D*mm Vulnerable Web Application or DVWA and uses modern tools such as Elk for monitoring.

This design also contains elements of Docker, Ansible and Azure cloud services, including the use of High Availability (HA) technologies.

### Introduction
These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the Ansible file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

This project also contains the following details:
- Network Design Topology
- Access Control Policies
- ELK Configuration, including Configuration of monitoring software below
  - MetricBeat Setup
  - FileBeat Setup
- Use of Ansible for Automated Deployment.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.

### Network Design
The following design below is a representation of an Azure Cloud setup of the Elk stack, including the setup of a Load Balancer and use of network security groups to limit the flow of traffic using rule based control.

In this design, all traffic was restricted to each of our personal IPv4 public IP addresses.

### Resources

**Virtual Machines**
* x4 Ubuntu based machines (tested using Ubuntu Server LTS 20.04)
* x1 client workstation, or a device capable of displaying a browser.

**Networking Requirements**
* NAT or Bridged Network
* Traefik Reverse Proxy for HTTP traffic (or a Azure Load Balancer and NSG rule)

* x2 VMs with 2vCPUs and 2Gbs Memory
* x1 VM with 1vCPU and 2Gbs Memory 

**Knowledge and Skills**
This project is designed to help new cyber security professionals log and monitor internal systems, including. the below are assumed skills
* Intermediate Linux directory navigation and diagnostic skills.
* Understanding of virtualization software and technologies, such as containerization and hypervisors

**Network Access Policies**
The machines on the internal network (vNet) are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Using the diagram above and the table below, the only allowed port will be SSH for external access, this is additionally secured using a SSH key for an extra layer of security.

**Network Addresses**

The below table contains the IP address information for each virtual machine, including its function and operating system.

| Name      | Function                                     | IP Address | Operating System |

| Jump Host |                                | SSH           |


### Docker Containers

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
* 10.0.0.5
* 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
* FileBeat - Syslog monitoring
* MetricBeat - System Resource monitoring

Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them either to Elk for monitoring and even history.

Metricbeat takes the metrics and statistics that it collects and ships them to Elk for further processing, this can be used for historical logs. 

when used in conjunction with each other, this is a powerful monitoring tool for any Security operations center.


### Using the Playbook


### Ansible Setup
In this project, all configuration was performed using Ansible scripts in the ```Ansible``` folder above. This is also secured by using SSH keys for each of the host machines on the virtual network.

use ``ssh-keygen`` to create a new SSH public key then ``cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub`` to get the key content. Modify the ``sshd`` file and disable password based authentication.

Ansible is used to automate deployments of network infrastructure and applications, it has various applications and use cases.

For this project the steps are as follows

1. Create an SSH Key on your home machine with `ssh-keygen`
2. Create 4 New Virtual Machine with Ubuntu (Web-1, 2, Elk Stack and Jump Host)
2.1. Create a availability set for both web machines to allow for additional redundancy.
3. Connect both Web virtual machines to the same virtual network (vNet)
4. Connect Jump Host to web network
4. Install Docker on Jump Host
5. Import cyberx/ansible docker container using `docker pull`
6. Start and access the Ansible container using `docker attach`
7. Setup an SSH key on the Ansible container to be imported on Web 1 and 2

### Elk Setup

Using the Ansible playbook, edit the Ansible host file and include your elk machine ip in the `elk` servers.

Provision the new docker container using the `project1-elk-server.yml` file and `ansible-playbook <filepath>`

![Elk Docker PS Command](images/docker_ps_elk.png)

Copy the content of the ``Ansible`` folder into a Linux machine with Ansible installed.

**NOTE**: Edit the `hosts:` part of the file to target another machine or set of Ansible hosts.

use the following to run the ansible playbook on the trageted machine located in the playbook file.
```
ansible-playbook ./project1-elk-server.yml
```

Then do the same for the two DVWA machines. This will install ``docker.io`` and download the DVWA application in a docker container.
```
ansible-playbook ./project1-webservers.yml
```


### Monitoring with MetricBeats and FileBeat
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- 10.0.0.5
- 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Web-1
- Web-2

Using the `system` module of Elk and MetricBeat. this has been configured to monitor for system events and record all logs from the `/var/log/*` directory. this includes authentication events, CPU, memory and storage use.

you can find an example of the end result for MetricBeat here.

![](images/MetricBeat_Example_Final.png)

and FileBeat here.

to confirm Elk is running, navigate to ``https://<ip address>:5601``
else use ``curl`` against the above address.
